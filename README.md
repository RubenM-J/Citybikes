Branch: **master**

## Short description

I made this app using an open-source API (http://api.citybik.es/v2/) that provides data on bike rentals all over the world.
This was a project to prove to myself I knew the basic concept of developing an Android app.

I used the following concepts:

* MainActivity
* Settings
* Profile
* Google Maps API
* Master detail / Recycler List
* Detail View

## Extras

* Location based services
* Camera animations
* Supporting landscape & portrait mode

### Thanks
Special thanks to Michiel for some help.
